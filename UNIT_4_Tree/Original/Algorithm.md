1.	Start the program.
2.	Read the number of elements n and validate that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000.
3.	Generate an ascending sequence containing values from 1 to n.
4.	Reverse a copy of the ascending sequence to create descending order.
5.	Shuffle another copy to create a random sequence.
6.	Construct a separate BST for each sequence by inserting its elements in order.
7.	Calculate the height of each BST recursively. Return 0 for a NULL node; otherwise return 1 + max(left height, right height).
8.	Display all three sequences and their heights.
9.	Compare the results and analyze the effect of insertion order.
10.	Delete all tree nodes to release memory, then stop.
